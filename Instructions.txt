2. Copy the '.jpg' source image file you wish to quantize to the same directory.
3. Open the Matlab software and the program from the directory.
5. Run the program and follow the instructions there.
6. The output file will be generated in the Matlab directory

After executing the program your Matlab command window will look like this,

Enter source file name input.jpg
Enter output file name output.jpg
