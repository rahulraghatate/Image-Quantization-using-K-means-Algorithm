# Image-Quantization-using-K-means-Algorithm


## **[Report](https://github.com/rahulraghatate/Image-Quantization-using-K-means-Algorithm/blob/master/Report.pdf)** consist of the Methodology and the Results explained in details.

## **Code Use**

This program uses the K-means clustering method to quantize an image file.

To use this program follow the instructions,
1. Copy the program file **[code.m](https://github.com/rahulraghatate/Image-Quantization-using-K-means-Algorithm/blob/master/code.m)** to your Matlab directory.
2. Copy the '.jpg' source image files from **[images.zip](https://github.com/rahulraghatate/Image-Quantization-using-K-means-Algorithm/blob/master/images.zip)** you wish to quantize to the same directory.
3. Open the Matlab software and the program from the directory.
5. Run the program and follow the instructions there.
6. The output file will be generated in the Matlab directory

After executing the program your Matlab command window will look like this,
```
Enter source file name input.jpg
Enter output file name output.jpg
Enter quantization levels for each colour 2
Enter iterations 1
    0.1028    0.1354    0.1335
```
